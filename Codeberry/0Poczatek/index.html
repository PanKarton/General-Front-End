        <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1><br>
              
             <p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. They have large, complex eyes and are highly colored.</p><br>

        <h2>Attack</h2><br>
            
            <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p><br>
           
            <p>They strike by unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey and can cause serious damage to victims larger than themselves.</p><br>
            
        <h2>Eyesight</h2><br>
            
            <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p><br>
            
            <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light and color vision outside the normal <em>spectrum</em>.</p><br><br>
